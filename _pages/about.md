Since September 2021 I am a postdoc in the Computational Bioimaging and BioInformatics group at École normale supérieure / PSL University. Currently, I am working on developing deep learning methods to improve the spatial resolution of microscopy images.

I did my PhD at the Inria research center in Rennes, under the supervision of Teddy Furon and Laurent Amsaleg, which I defended in July 2021. I was a member of the LinkMedia research team, which is focused on extracting and representing information from multimedia. 

My Ph.D. was part of "ID_IoT," a European project, where we developed privacy-preserving algorithms for authentication and identification of low-power devices in IoT. My main contribution to the project was “designing privacy-preserving group membership verification schemes to check if a device or an individual is a member of a group without revealing the identity of that member”.




I received my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from Sharif University of Technology in 2014. I did my master thesis in the Machine Learning Lab, where I was advised by Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah. During my master and also after that as a research assistant I worked on Domain Adaptation for cross-domain image classification problems.
